# 2.8 Intermediate Code Generation

## Exercise 2.8.1
For-statements in C and Java have the form:

```
for ( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 ) stmt
```

The first expression is executed before the loop; it is typically used
for initializing the loop index. The second expression is a test made
before each iteration of the loop; the loop is exited if the
expression becomes 0. The loop itself can be thought of as the
statement `{stmt expr3;}`. The third expression is executed
at the end of each iteration; it is typically used to increment the
loop index. The meaning of the for-statement is similar to

```
expr1; while ( expr2 ) {stmt expr3; }
```

Define a class `For` for for-statements, similar to class `If` in
Fig. 2.43.

**Answer:**
```java
class For extends Stmt {
    Expr E1, E2, E3;
    Stmt S;
    Label start, end;

    public For (Expr e1, Expr e2, Expr e3, Stmt s) {
        E1 = e1;
        E2 = e2;
        E3 = e3;
        S = s;

        start = newLabel();
        end = newLabel();
    }

    public void gen() {
        E1.gen();
        emit(start + ":");
        Expr i = E2.rvalue();
        emit("ifFalse " + i.toString + " goto " + end);
        S.gen();
        E3.gen();
        emit("goto " + start);
        emit(end + ":");
    }
}
```

## Exercise 2.8.2
The programming language C does not have a boolean type. Show how a C
compiler might translate an if-statement into three-address code.

**Answer:**
```java
class If extends Stmt {
    Expr E; Stmt S;
    Label after;

    public If (Expr x, Stmt y) {
        E = x;
        S = y;

        after = newLabel();
    }

    public void gen() {
        Expr n = E.rvalue();
        Tmp t = newTemporary();
        emit(t.lvalue().toString + " = " + n.toString() + " == 0");
        emit("ifTrue " + t.rvalue().toString() + " goto " + after);
        S.gen();
        emit(after + ":");
    }
}
```
