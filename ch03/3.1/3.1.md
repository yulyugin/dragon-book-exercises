# 3.1 The Role of the Lexical Analyzer

## Exercise 3.1.1
Divide the following C++ program:

```C++
float limitedSquare(x) float x; {
    /* returns x-squared, but never more than 100 */
    return (x<=-10.0||x>=10.0)?100:x*x;
}
```

into appropriate lexemes, using the discussion of Section 3.1.2 as a
guide. Which lexemes should get associated lexical values? What should
those values be?

**Answer:**
```
<FLOAT_TYPE>
<ID, pointer to symbol-table entry for limitedSquare>
<(>
<ID, pointer to symbol-table entry for x>
<)>
<FLOAT_TYPE>
<ID, pointer to symbol-table entry for x>
<;>
<{>

<RETURN>
<(>
<ID, pointer to symbol-table for x>
<LESS_OR_EQUAL_OP>
<NUMBER, -10.0>
<OR_OP, "||">
<ID, pointer to symbol-table for x>
<MORE_OR_EQUAL_OP>
<NUMBER, 10.0>
<)>
<?>
<NUMBER, 100>
<:>
<ID, pointer to symbol-table for x>
<MULTIPLY_OP>
<ID, pointer to symbol-table for x>
<;>

<}>
```

 ## Exercise 3.1.2
Tagged languages like HTML or XML are different from conventional
programming languages in that the punctuation (tags) are either very
numerous (as in HTML) or a user-definable set (as in XML). Further,
tags can often have parameters. Suggest how to divide the following
HTML document:

```html
Here is a photo of <B>my house</B>:
<P><IMG SRC = "house.gif"><BR>
See <A HREF = "morePix.html">More Pictures</A> if you
liked that one.<P>
```

into appropriate lexemes. Which lexemes should get associated lexical
values, and what should those values be?

**Answer:**
```
<TEXT, "Here is a photo of ">
<OPEN_TAG, "B">
<END_TAG_MARKER>
<TEXT, "my house">
<CLOSE_TAG, "B">
<END_TAG_MARKER>
<TEXT, ":">

<OPEN_TAG, "P">
<END_TAG_MARKER>
<OPEN_TAG, "IMG">
<ATTR_NAME, "SRC">
<EQ>
<ATTR_VALUE, "house.gif">
<END_TAG_MARKER>
<OPEN_TAG, "BR">
<END_TAG_MARKER>

<TEXT, "See ">
<OPEN_TAG, "A">
<ATTR_NAME, "HREF">
<EQ>
<ATTR_VALUE, "morePix.html">
<END_TAG_MARKER>
<TEXT, "More Pictures">
<CLOSE_TAG, "A">
<END_TAG_MARKER>
<TEXT, "if you liked that one.">

<OPEN_TAG, "P">
<END_TAG_MARKER>
```
