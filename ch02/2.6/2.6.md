# 2.6 Lexical Analysis

## Exercise 2.6.1
Extend the lexical analyzer in Section 2.6.5 to remove comments, defined as follows:

a) A comment begins with `//` and includes all characters until the end of
that line.

b) A comment begins with `/*` and includes all characters through the next
occurrence of the character sequence `*/`.

See `removeComment` function in [Lexer.java](./src/lexer/Lexer.java).

## Exercise 2.6.2
Extend the lexical analyzer in Section 2.6.5 to recognize the
relational operators `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `>`.

See `scanRelationOperators` function in [Lexer.java](./src/lexer/Lexer.java).

## Exercise 2.6.3
Extend the lexical analyzer in Section 2.6.5 to recognize
foating point numbers such as `2.`, `3.14`, and `.5`.

See `scanNumbers` function in [Lexer.java](./src/lexer/Lexer.java).
