# 3.1 The Role of the Lexical Analyzer

## Exercise 3.1.1
Divide the following C++ program:

```
float limitedSquare(x) float x; {
    /* returns x-squared, but never more than 100 */
    return (x<=-10.0||x>=10.0)?100:x*x;
}
```

into appropriate lexemes, using the discussion of Section 3.1.2 as a
guide. Which lexemes should get associated lexical values? What should
those values be?

```
<float> <id, pointer to symbol-table entry for limitedSquare> <(> <id, pointer to symbol-table entry for x> <)> <float> <id, pointer to symbol-table entry for x> <;> <{>

<return> <(> <id, pointer to symbol-table for x> <op, "<="> <number, -10.0> <op, "||"> <id, pointer to symbol-table for x> <op, ">="> <number, 10.0> <)> <?> <number, 100> <:> <id, pointer to symbol-table for x> <op, "*"> <id, pointer to symbol-table for x> <;>

<}>
```

 ## Exercise 3.1.2
Tagged languages like HTML or XML are different from conventional
programming languages in that the punctuation (tags) are either very
numerous (as in HTML) or a user-definable set (as in XML). Further,
tags can often have parameters. Suggest how to divide the following
HTML document:

```
Here is a photo of <B>my house</B>:
<P><IMG SRC = "house.gif"><BR>
See <A HREF = "morePix.html">More Pictures</A> if you
liked that one.<P>
```

into appropriate lexemes. Which lexemes should get associated lexical
values, and what should those values be?

```
<text: "Here is a photo of "><start_tag, "B"><text, "my house"><end_tag, "B"><text, ":">
<start_tag, "P"><start_tag, "IMG"><attr, {"SRC", "house.gif"}><start_tag, "BR">
<text, "See "><start_tag, "A"><attr, {"HREF", "morePix.html"}><text, "More Pictures"><end_tag, "A"><text, "if you liked that one.">
<start_tag, "P">
```
