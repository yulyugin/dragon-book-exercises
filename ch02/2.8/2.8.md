# 2.8 Intermediate Code Generation

## Exercise 2.8.1
For-statements in C and Java have the form:

```
for ( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 ) stmt
```

The first expression is executed before the loop; it is typically used
for initializing the loop index. The second expression is a test made
before each iteration of the loop; the loop is exited if the
expression becomes 0. The loop itself can be thought of as the
statement `{stmt expr3;}`. The third expression is executed
at the end of each iteration; it is typically used to increment the
loop index. The meaning of the for-statement is similar to

```
expr1; while ( expr2 ) {stmt expr3; }
```

Define a class `For` for for-statements, similar to class `If` in
Fig. 2.43.

```
class For extends Stmt {
    Expr E1, E2, E3;
    Stmt S;

    public For (Expr e1, Expr e2, Expr e3, Stmt s) {
        E1 = e1;
        E2 = e2;
        E3 = e3;
        S = s;
    }

    public void gen() {
        Start = newlabel();
        End = newlabel();

        E1.gen();
        emit(Start + ":");
        Expr i = E2.rvalue();
        emit("ifFalse " + i.toString + "goto " + End);
        S.gen();
        E3.gen();
        emit("goto " + Start);
        emit(End + ":");
    }
}
```
